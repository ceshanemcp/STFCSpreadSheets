## Step 1
Fill in the amount of Tokens that you will have (Estimated or Actual)

## Step 2
Shop on the right hand side.  Choose what you are looking to purchase.  I have the cost and limits added to make this easier.

When you select something to buy.  The spreadsheet will fill in the *Total* amount.  This will format a Remaining number that is negative to Red :red_circle: indicating that you do not have enough loot to purchase the items you want.  This could be helpful for determining what you need to earn or purchase.

This will also update the column on the left with your purchase amount and let you know what is remaining.  

### Notes:  

> The spreadsheet does know when you have hit a limit and should not be able to purchase the amount you entered.

> This is being managed in the spreadsheet using the red color to indicate an error.  This can be modified to block entry, but I use this to estimate how much loot I might expect to need in a future store to purchase the remaining (in this case) blueprints.
